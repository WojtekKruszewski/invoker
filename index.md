title: Invoker - A Process Manager
---

## What is Invoker?
Invoker is a utility belt for managing processes in development environment.
Use it for managing multiple processes with ease.

Use it for developing web applications on different local domains without
`/etc/hosts` hacks.

Invoker supports DNS and proxying of HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket applications over a `.local`
like local TLD.

## Features

A brief overview of Invoker features are:

* Manage multiple dependent processes using Invoker. You can use Procfile or a INI file to define multiple processes managed by Invoker.
* Invoker supports proxying to your HTTP application via a locally defined TLD like `.local`
* Invoker automatically supports HTTPS, Websocket for your application.
* Any externally running HTTP application can use HTTP proxy of Invoker for access via `http://app.local` domain.


## How to use it?

First we need to install invoker gem to get command line utility called invoker, we can do that via:

{% highlight bash %}
~> gem install invoker
{% endhighlight %}

Currently it only works with Ruby >= 1.9.3.

You need to start by creating a `ini` file which will define processes you want to manage using invoker. An example `ini` file is included in the repo.

{% highlight bash %}
[rails]
directory = /home/gnufied/god_particle
command = bundle exec rails s -p 5000

[dj]
directory = /home/gnufied/god_particle
command = bundle exec ruby script/delayed_job

[events]
directory = /home/gnufied/god_particle
command = bundle exec ruby script/event_server
{% endhighlight %}

After that you can start process manager via:

{% highlight bash %}
~> invoker start invoker.ini
{% endhighlight %}

Above command will start all your processes in one terminal with their stdout/stderr merged and labelled. You
can also start `Invoker` by daeomonizing it, via:

{% highlight bash %}
~> invoker start invoker.ini -d
{% endhighlight %}

## .local TLD support for OSX and Linux.

You can access http services managed by invoker via `command_label.local` domain locally.

To make it work though, you need to run following command, just once from anywhere:

{% highlight bash %}
~> sudo invoker setup # read below if you are migrating from Pow
{% endhighlight %}

This feature has been well tested to work on both `OSX` and `Linux`. You can additionally
run above command with:

{% highlight bash %}
~> sudo invoker setup --tld local #specify a custom TLD, the default is `dev`
{% endhighlight %}

If you decide to remove Invoker, you can remove things installed by Invoker using command

{% highlight bash %}
~> sudo invoker uninstall
{% endhighlight %}

Now because invoker is making your app server available on a domain. It requires
control over port(or needs to know the port) on which your applications will be listening. This can be simply done by replacing specific port number in `ini` file with `$PORT` or by specifying
a port key. For example:

{% highlight bash %}
[terminal]
directory = /home/gnufied/ayr-terminal
port = 3000
command = node app

[cms]
directory = /home/gnufied/mezzainine
command = python manage.py runserver $PORT --noreload

[typo]
directory = /home/gnufied/typo
command = bundle exec rails s -p $PORT

[activemq]
directory = /home/gnufied/tmp
command = activemq-admin start
# prevent Invoker from automatically starting the process
# on start and the process can be manually started later via
# invoker add activemq
disable_autorun = true
{% endhighlight %}

Now these services can be accessed via `http://terminal.local` , `http://cms.local`
`http://typo.local`. You can also access them via wildcard subdomains such as `*.*.local`.

You can also access any external http process via `.local` DNS by running
following command:

{% highlight bash %}
~> invoker add_http wordpress 8080
{% endhighlight %}

Above command will make wordpress available on `wordpress.local` even if
wordpress was original not started by Invoker. You can access any randomly
started process via Invoker like this.

## Https support

Invoker uses a self-signed certificate to make all your web applications available via
`https` as well. You absolutely don't have to do anything. Access your webapps on `https://app.local`
and enjoy!


<a name="procfile"></a>
## Procfile support

Invoker is 100% compatbile with `Procfile` format used by Heroku. If you
have been using a `Procfile` to bootstrap your development stack, you can
keep using it with `Invoker.`

The only thing to remember is, your `Procfile`
must have `$PORT` in command - for `.local` domain feature to work

{% highlight bash %}
rails: cd $HOME/rails_app && bundle exec rails s -p $PORT
cms: cd $HOME/cms && python manage.py runserver $PORT
{% endhighlight %}

<a name="process"></a>
## Process managment

Additionally Invoker allows you to manage individual processes. You can start/stop/restart
different processes managed by invoker without affecting others. Following commands work
for processes started by `Procfile` as well.

{% highlight bash %}
# Will try to stop running delayed job by sending SIGINT to the process
~> invoker remove dj

# If Process can't be killed by SIGINT send a custom signal
~> invoker remove dj -s 9

# add and start running
~> invoker add dj

# List currently running processes managed by invoker
~> invoker list
 +-----------------------------------+-------+------+--------------+----------------+
 | dir                               | pid   | port | process_name | shell_command  |
 +-----------------------------------+-------+------+--------------+----------------+
 | /Users/goromlagche/proj_1         | 21549 | 9000 | pj1          | bundle exec .. |
 | /Users/goromlagche/proj_2         | 21550 | 9001 | pj2          | bundle exec .. |
 | /Users/goromlagche/proj_3         | 21551 | 9002 | pj3          | bundle exec .. |
 |                                   | 21552 |      | redis        | redis-server   |
 +-----------------------------------+-------+------+--------------+----------------+

# Restart process given by command Label
~> invoker reload dj

# Restart process given by command label using specific signal for killing
~> invoker reload dj -s 9

# tail logs of specified process. This is specially useful if you started
# invoker daemonized or you want to watch logs of just one process discarding
# others.
~> invoker tail dj

{% endhighlight %}

You can also enable OSX notifications for crashed processes by installing terminal-notifier gem. It is not a
dependency, but can be useful if something crashed and you weren't paying attention.

<a name="pow"></a>
## Migrating from Pow

If you are migrating from Pow then first step before running `invoker setup` is to uninstall Pow:

{% highlight bash %}
curl get.pow.cx/uninstall.sh | sh
{% endhighlight %}

After that you should run `invoker setup`
as usual. If for some reason you can't uninstall Pow via above
command (in case you installed Pow using homebrew), then you
should remove Pow daemon manually.

After running `invoker setup` you will
have to <em>switch off wi-fi and then switch it on </em> for
resettng OSX network configuration.

## ZSH completion

Invoker comes with a <em>ZSH</em> completion script
`contrib/completion/invoker-completion.zsh`. Drop this somewhere in your
`$fpath` (`~/.zsh` for example) and rename the file to `_invoker`.

## Credits

Invoker is hugely inspired by <a href="http://pow.cx">pow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">Foreman</a>.
It stands on the shoulder of awesome work done by folks who created Pow & Foreman. The Codemancers team is immensely grateful to them.
